## RÃ©mi de Fleurian

I am a PhD candidate in the [Music Cognition Lab](http://music-cognition.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), part of the [Cognitive Science Research Group](http://cogsci.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) at QMUL. My research aims to better understand why we enjoy listening to music, by attempting to predict pleasurable moments in music, using behavioural and computational methods. I am particularly interested in the effects of musical expectancy on aesthetic responses.
